# Java_Chip8_Emu
a very simple chip 8 emulator writen in java, this is my first emulator so its very crappy and broken

the emulated cicle runs at 500hz

it passes the inpotants test (https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite)

fell fre to use the code if you want.. but its a very bad code :P

# know bugs

- font sprites not working properly on some games
- some games dont work as intended (probably some broken instruction in my code) 
- the emulator doesnt have sound (i didnt implemented)
